## 11 Big Mac Index

**2018 Week 31**

open-source data: [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w31-big-mac-index) <br>
data repository [github](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data)

The Big Mac Index, created by The Economist, is a lighthearted guide to currency valuation based on Purchasing-Power Parity (PPP). It compares the prices of Big Macs in different countries to assess exchange rate fairness suggesting that exchange rates should eventually align to equalize prices of the same goods and services across different countries.

- For instance, in Switzerland, which has the highest Big Mac index, the cost of a Big Mac is CHF 6.5, while it is $5.1 in the US. Consequently, when comparing product prices, the implied exchange rate is 1.28, whereas the actual exchange rate is 0.95. This suggests that the Swiss franc was approximately 34% overvalued compared to the US dollar.

## 09 Bank Marketing Research

open-source [data](https://data.world/bobmajor/sales](https://data.world/data-society/bank-marketing-data)

- As a result of analyzing customers who have achieved positive outcomes in bank marketing, they show a **high percentage in single, highly educated, and non-working occupations such as students or retired. **

- In addition, the marketing that yielded positive results had **a call duration more than twice** that of the negative cases, typically spanning around 9 minutes on average.

- Regarding marketing effectiveness, **the longer the time interval or the weaker the association with past marketing-related interactions**, the more favourable the marketing outcomes.

- It shows that approximately 99% of customers who subscribed to marketing products did not experience **Defaults**. However, the **Housing Loan** presence did not significantly impact this outcome.

## 08 Factors Affecting Profitability

open-source data: [data.world](https://data.world/bobmajor/sales)

- **There is no notable variance in profitability across regions**. While a specific region generated high revenue, it appears that costs also rose in proportion to the returns.

- Clothing stands out as the most profitable item, with a profitability of 67%. Interestingly, the top three items with the highest revenue occupy lower positions in the profitability ranking. **This suggests that there is no significant relationship between profitability and revenue per item.**

- No substantial association is observed between Profitability and Sales Channels.

## 07 How Discount Affects Profitability


- As the Discount increases, the Profit Ratio decreases consistently, indicating a negative correlation between the two variables. **Thus, they possess an inverse proportionality.**

- The **Consumer Segment** shows most instances of heavily discounted, unprofitable orders

- The top 25 customers with the lowest profitability have consistently placed orders with significant discounts. **Unprofitable orders probably correspond to heavily discounted.**

## 03 Worst Performing Sub-Categories in Sales

- Which three worst-performing sub-categories for profit by region?

  + Region attribute used for pop-up operation. When the user clicks on one of the area values, such as East, only the East value pops up in the Box-and-Whisker plot.
  + The enclosure was used to meet Gestalt principles. I coloured the three worst-performing sub-categories red and the rest grey.
  + To reduce the cognitive load and declutter, I also plotted the two overall graphs.
