## 13 Dog Bites in NYC

**2023 Week 22**

open-source data: [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w22) <br>

- The primary factors contributing to dog bite accidents include aggressive breeds, neutralization, borough, and season. Additionally, seasonality plays a role in the level of outdoor activities dogs engage in, influenced by weather and temperature. And each borough considers factors such as income level and population density.

- In general, dog bites showed an upward trend with mild weather conditions from April to September. These incidents were more prevalent in areas with a lower neutering rate and boroughs characterized by lower income levels.

- **Pit Bulls** are responsible for a significantly higher number of dog bites compared to other breeds, ranging from 2 to 10 times more incidents per year and borough.

## 11 Big Mac Index

**2018 Week 31**

open-source data: [data.world](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2018w31-big-mac-index) <br>
data repository [github](https://github.com/TheEconomist/big-mac-data)

The Big Mac Index, created by The Economist, is a lighthearted guide to currency valuation based on Purchasing-Power Parity (PPP). It compares the prices of Big Macs in different countries to assess exchange rate fairness suggesting that exchange rates should eventually align to equalize prices of the same goods and services across different countries.

- For instance, in Switzerland, which has the highest Big Mac index, the cost of a Big Mac is CHF 6.5, while it is $5.1 in the US. Consequently, when comparing product prices, the implied exchange rate is 1.28, whereas the actual exchange rate is 0.95. This suggests that the Swiss franc was approximately 34% overvalued compared to the US dollar.

open-source [data](https://data.world/bobmajor/sales](https://data.world/data-society/bank-marketing-data)

- As a result of analyzing customers who have achieved positive outcomes in bank marketing, they show a **high percentage in single, highly educated, and non-working occupations such as students or retired. **

- In addition, the marketing that yielded positive results had **a call duration more than twice** that of the negative cases, typically spanning around 9 minutes on average.

- Regarding marketing effectiveness, **the longer the time interval or the weaker the association with past marketing-related interactions**, the more favourable the marketing outcomes.

- It shows that approximately 99% of customers who subscribed to marketing products did not experience **Defaults**. However, the **Housing Loan** presence did not significantly impact this outcome.

## 08 Factors Affecting Profitability

open-source data: [data.world](https://data.world/bobmajor/sales)

- **There is no notable variance in profitability across regions**. While a specific region generated high revenue, it appears that costs also rose in proportion to the returns.

- Clothing stands out as the most profitable item, with a profitability of 67%. Interestingly, the top three items with the highest revenue occupy lower positions in the profitability ranking. **This suggests that there is no significant relationship between profitability and revenue per item.**

- No substantial association is observed between Profitability and Sales Channels.

## 07 How Discount Affects Profitability


- As the Discount increases, the Profit Ratio decreases consistently, indicating a negative correlation between the two variables. **Thus, they possess an inverse proportionality.**

- The **Consumer Segment** shows most instances of heavily discounted, unprofitable orders

- The top 25 customers with the lowest profitability have consistently placed orders with significant discounts. **Unprofitable orders probably correspond to heavily discounted.**

## 03 Worst Performing Sub-Categories in Sales

- Which three worst-performing sub-categories for profit by region?
